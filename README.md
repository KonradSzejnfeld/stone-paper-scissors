# Game goals:

The game is to consist of any number of rounds and last until one of the players has scored 10 points.

After clicking the 'New Game' button, you will be asked to enter your name.

The game will then start and instead of the 'New Game' button, the 'Stone', 'Paper', 'Shears' and a table showing the selection of players and the result of the round.

The table shows the player's and opponent's name, in this case it is to be a 'computer' and the score.

When a player scores 10 points instead of the 'tile', 'paper' and 'scissors' buttons, the sign 'Player won [Name of player]' will appear with the 'Play again' button below with the same functionality as the 'New Game' button.
